# What is .NET?

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many kinds of applications. You can run programs written in multiple languages, with C# being the most popular. It relies on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale applications.

## Key Features

.NET provides a modern development platform with the following core capabilities:

- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Open source**: Licensed under MIT with active community contributions
- **High performance**: Optimized runtime used by production applications at scale
- **Type and memory safe**: Automatic memory management via garbage collector
- **Multiple languages**: Supports C#, F#, Visual Basic, and more
- **Asynchronous programming**: First-class `async`/`await` support for responsive applications

## .NET Ecosystem

The .NET ecosystem includes multiple implementations designed for different scenarios:

### .NET (Modern .NET)
Modern .NET is a cross-platform and open source implementation designed for cloud-native applications. It actively supports Linux, macOS, and Windows and is the recommended choice for new development.

### .NET Framework
The original .NET implementation that provides access to Windows and Windows Server capabilities. It remains actively supported in maintenance mode.

### Mono
A community-driven, cross-platform implementation focused on mobile and gaming scenarios, including Android, iOS, and WebAssembly.

## Core Components

.NET consists of several key components working together:

1. **Runtime**: Executes application code with features like garbage collection and type safety
2. **Libraries**: Comprehensive set of APIs for common functionality like JSON parsing, HTTP clients, and data access
3. **Compiler**: Compiles C# and other languages into executable code
4. **SDK and Tools**: Modern toolchain for building, testing, and deploying applications
5. **App Stacks**: Frameworks like ASP.NET Core for web applications and .NET MAUI for cross-platform apps

## Design Principles

.NET follows these core design principles:

- **Productivity is full-stack**: Runtime, libraries, languages, and tools all contribute to developer experience
- **Safe code is primary**: Memory and type safety by default, with opt-in unsafe code for performance scenarios
- **Cross-platform portability**: Code runs on multiple operating systems and chip architectures
- **Industry standards**: Embraces standards like OpenTelemetry and gRPC over proprietary solutions
- **Performance focused**: Optimized for modern hardware and cloud workloads

## Application Types

You can build diverse applications with .NET:

- **Web applications**: Modern web apps and APIs with ASP.NET Core
- **Cloud services**: Microservices and serverless applications
- **Desktop applications**: Windows Forms, WPF, and cross-platform with .NET MAUI
- **Mobile applications**: iOS and Android apps using .NET MAUI
- **Games**: Using Unity or other game engines
- **IoT applications**: Lightweight applications for connected devices
- **Machine learning**: ML.NET for data science and AI scenarios

## Package Management

.NET uses NuGet as its package manager, providing access to hundreds of thousands of packages that implement functionality for many scenarios. Most applications rely on NuGet packages for some functionality through the [NuGet Gallery](https://nuget.org/).

## Getting Started

To start building with .NET:

1. [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) for your platform
2. Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/get-started)
3. Explore the [.NET documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/)
4. Try the [.NET 101 video series](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/videos)

## Support and Community

.NET is supported by Microsoft and a global community through:

- **Regular releases**: Annual major releases in November with monthly security updates
- **Multiple platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux on Arm64, x64, and x86 architectures  
- **Long-term support**: LTS releases provide extended support lifecycles
- **Active community**: Contributions welcome through GitHub repositories
